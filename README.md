# Data structures: Linked lists

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can implement the following:

- A complete Queue using only a LinkedList
- An algorithm to delete all duplicate values from a *sorted* linked list
- A complete Stack using only a LinkedList
- A Parking Lot that uses a Queue when the lot is full
- An algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome using a Stack

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

> *Note: If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run* `npm install`.
>
> 1.  *Check which version you are running:* `node -v`
> 2.  *If needed, change the version to v18:* `nvm use v18`
>
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.\
To do so, you will be modifying an existing `LinkedList` class.

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

1.  In the `src/linked-list/queue.js` file, implement a complete Queue using only a LinkedList.
2.  In the `src/removeDuplicates.js` file, implement an algorithm to delete all duplicate values from a *sorted* linked list. Values may be numbers or strings.
3.  In the `src/linked-list/stack.js` file, implement a complete Stack using only a LinkedList.
4.  In the `src/queue/parkingLot.js` file, implement a Parking Lot that uses a Queue when the lot is full.
5.  In the `src/stack/isPalindrome.js` file, implement an algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome using a Stack.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
